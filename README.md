# Genetic Fuzzy Model for E-Commerce Security and Trust

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a Genetic Fuzzy Model for investigating security and trust in e-commerce using a genetic algorithm. The system is designed to learn fuzzy rules for classifying online activities as safe or unsafe (e.g., intrusion detection) based on training data.

## Overview

The system combines fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to:
- Preprocess and normalize security-related data.
- Teach fuzzy membership functions and generate fuzzy rules.
- Optimize the fuzzy rule set using a genetic algorithm.
- Evaluate the classifier using performance metrics (ROC curves, accuracy, etc.).
